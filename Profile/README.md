# Introduction

**Theme**: Fusion Unleashed: Art, Entertainment, and Media Transformation

The world is full of art galleries showcasing various forms of art. However, not everyone can comprehend the meaning and genre of the art they are viewing, especially if it is too complex to understand. This can be quite disheartening for people who wish to appreciate art in its true form. This is where ArtNaon comes in to provide a solution to this problem. ArtNaon simplifies the process of identifying art and provides an explanation of the art genre to make it easier for everyone to understand. In addition to this, ArtNaon also aims to help people appreciate art for its emotions and feelings, not just for its aesthetic value. It encourages people to delve deeper into the art to understand the artist's thought process behind the creation, helping them connect with the art and appreciate it from a different perspective.

ArtNaon is the application to get when you want to learn to identify art. This application helps new art enthusiasts distinguish different genres of art paintings just by taking a picture of the painting. They can also chat with a chatbot to ask questions about art paintings.
